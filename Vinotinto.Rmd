# Fifa Data Scrapping using R {.tabset} 

Having played soccer since I can remember, through college in NSU Florida and pick up games almost every week inspired me to start a soccer data and analytics project. Perhaps, to find ways to help the national team of my country to qualify to the next Soccer World Cup ever in 2022, their first one ever. Well yes big dreams! 

This article shows how to scrape data from the soccer game FIFA 2020, using the website www.SOfifa.com which updates and maintains the player stats on a weekly basis. These data is not real performance data about the player with their respective club or national team games, but provides a rough estimate of the player's skills. 

More than 70 attributes can be scrapped from the SOFifa website including nationaility, overall score, shooting, defense and dribbling to name a few. This article will cover how to scrape 3:

- Player's name

- Overall Rating

- Club Team

However, the same practice can be applied to scrape all other attributes of the player. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
