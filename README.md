# Conmebol Soccer Data Analysis - (Work in Progress)

## Insipiration and Future Work

This short project has been created solely for enjoyment and learning purposes, however, we believe that similar approaches can be performed at scale, capturing strong signals of a player's season, latest games played information and multiple data points beyond a soccer player's performance to automatically and effectively identify attractive buying opportunities during the transfer market window.

## Web Scraping SoFifa 

Used the Rvest package to scrape SoFifa's website and collect data from more than 1,000 soccer players from South America. Data collected includes, overall player's rating, player's height, market value, best position in the field, ball control, dribbling and more.

## Exploration Data Analysis of South American Soccer Players

Wrangled and visualized the scraped dataset using the Tidyverse ecosystem to generate and communicate quick insights. 

## Statistical Modelling for Player's Market Value 

(Work in Progress)

Pre-processed, resampled, modeled and evaluated multiple statistical models such as regularization and random forest methods using the Tidymodels ecosystem to understand drivers of the player's market value and make an objective estimation

## Publish Analysis and Model Deployment
